# Mu Torere

Mu Torere is a Maori game from New Zealand. This application is a personal Haskell learning exercise.

I found "Game Programming in Haskell" by Elise Huard to be quite helpful, particularly in the use of FRP for a game. Ultimately I found Elerea be a quite usable FRP, given the plethera of FRP implementations, c.f. [FRP Zoo](https://github.com/gelisam/frp-zoo).

I would like to have taken this a little further, such as adding players and computer play, but not wanting to draw my own, I was unable to find any good integration between Gloss and GUI widgets (e.g. buttons, combo boxes).
